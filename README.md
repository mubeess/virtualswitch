# Virtual Switch

Virtual Switch is a React Native app that interfaces with the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch and display posts. The app features search functionality and detailed post views.

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Configure SDK Path (Android Only)

Before running the Android build, you need to set your SDK path in the `local.properties` file under the `android` folder.

Add the following line, replacing `/path/to/your/sdk` with your actual Android SDK path:

```sh
sdk.dir=/path/to/your/sdk
```

## Step 3: Build and Run Your App

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 4: App Features

Virtual Switch offers the following key features:

1. **Post Listing:**

   - Fetches and displays a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
   - Each post shows the title and a preview of the content.

2. **Search Functionality:**

   - Use the search bar at the top to filter posts based on titles or content.
   - Results update in real-time as you type.

3. **Detail View:**
   - Tap on any post to view more detailed information.
   - The detail view shows the complete post content, author information, and related data.

## Step 5: Modify Your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes â€” this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.
